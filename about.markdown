I hope this blog will lasts long. I had many blog buts I have deleted it all. I hate what I wrote sometimes that's why I delete it when I looking back, everything from this moment soon become the part of the history, sometimes it worth reading, sometimes it's just a trash, but afters years it seemed mostly just trash. But from now on I think I should keep it, deal with it as it a part of present me and future me.

I'm think of setting up the comment feature but for most of the time I nerver see anyone give a fuck about what I wrote, so that just shoot me an email if you found this blog interesting.
